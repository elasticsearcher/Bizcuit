# Bizcuit
Bizcuit (from 'business kit') is an open source web application that's meant to help small business owners manage their business. It utilizes the power of Elasticsearch to make all business-related information available at lightning speed via full-text, natural language search capabilities and the UI is powered by the versatile ExtJS framework in order to deliver a familiar, desktop-like user experience in the browser.
