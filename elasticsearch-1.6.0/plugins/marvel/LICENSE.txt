                              Marvel Software License Agreement

READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, WHICH CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT AND GOVERNS YOUR USE OF
ELASTICSEARCH’S MARVEL SOFTWARE. BY INSTALLING AND/OR USING THE MARVEL SOFTWARE, YOU ARE INDICATING
THAT YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR USE THE MARVEL SOFTWARE.

This Marvel Software License Agreement (this “Agreement") is entered into by and between the
applicable Elasticsearch entity referred to in Attachment 1 below (“Elasticsearch”) and the person
or entity (“You”) that has downloaded Elasticsearch’s Marvel software to which this Agreement is
attached (“Marvel Software”).  This Agreement is effective as of the date an applicable ordering
document (“Order Form”) is entered into by Elasticsearch and You (the “Effective Date”).
 

1. Software License and Restrictions

1.1 License Grants. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and complete payment of
any and all applicable license fees (provided that no license fee shall be required for use of the

grant to You during the term and for the restricted scope of this Agreement, solely for Your
internal business operations, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license (without
the right to grant or authorize sublicenses) to: (i) install and use the object code version of the
Marvel Software, subject to any applicable quantitative limitations set forth in the applicable
Order Form; (ii) use, and distribute internally a reasonable number of copies of the documentation,
if any, provided with the Marvel Software (“Documentation”), provided that You must include on such
copies all Elasticsearch trademarks, trade names, logos and notices present on the Documentation as
originally provided to You by Elasticsearch; (iii) permit third party contractors performing
services on Your behalf to use the Marvel Software and Documentation as set forth in (i) and (ii)
above, provided that such use must be solely for Your benefit, and You shall be responsible for all
acts and omissions of such contractors in connection with their use of the Marvel Software.

1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Elasticsearch and You, Elasticsearch owns all
right title and interest in and to the Marvel Software and any derivative works thereof, and except
as expressly set forth in Section 1.1 above, no other license to the Marvel Software is granted to
You by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  You agree not to: (i) prepare derivative works from,
modify, copy or use the Marvel Software in any manner except as expressly permitted in this
Agreement or applicable law; (ii) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or

any analysis of the results of operation of the Marvel Software, including benchmarking results,
without the prior written consent of Elasticsearch.  The Marvel Software may contain or be provided

on a website designated by Elasticsearch or otherwise provided with the Marvel Software or
Documentation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the Open Source Software
shall be subject to the license terms and conditions applicable to such Open Source Software, to the
extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights
granted to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights). 1.3 Cluster Metadata.  You understand
and agree that once deployed, and on a daily basis, the Marvel Software provides metadata to
Elasticsearch about Your cluster statistics and associates that metadata with Your IP address.
However, no other information is provided to Elasticsearch by the Marvel Software, including any
information about the data You process or store in connection with your use of the Marvel Software.
Instructions for disabling this feature are contained in the Marvel Software, however leaving this
feature active enables Elasticsearch to gather cluster statistics and provide an improved level of
support to You.

force for the license term set forth in the applicable Order Form, unless earlier terminated under

terminate this Agreement for material breach by the other party automatically and without any other
formality, if such party has failed to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of

foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event that You intentionally breach
the scope of the license granted in Section 1.1 of this Agreement.

reason, You shall promptly cease the use of the Marvel Software and Documentation and destroy (and
